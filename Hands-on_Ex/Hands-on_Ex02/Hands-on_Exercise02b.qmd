## Getting Started

Objective of this exercise is discover aspatial point processes of childcare centers in Singapore by using 2nd order spatial point patterns analysis,w which unlike 1st order that only observe the distributions of points in the surface, the 2nd order examine spatial relationships between points ina pattern (how one point can influence the location of another point). In this exercise, we will be using spatstat library to answer teh following questions:

## Import Libraries

{r} pacman::p_load(sf, readr, dplyr, tidyr, tidyverse, ggplot2)

The libraries used in this exercise would be:

sf: simple features in R to encode and analyze spatial vector data

readr: fast way to read rectangular data from delimited files (e.g. csv and tsv)

dplyr: grammar of data manipulation (to work with data frame like objects)

tidyverse: collection of R packages that for data manipulation and visualization

tidyr: tool to create tidy data

ggplot2: create graphics based on "the Grammar of Objects"

The Data

In this hands-on exercise, we'll be using the following datasets:

<a href="https://data.gov.sg/datasets/d_d14da225fccf921049ab64238ff473d9/view">Master Plan 2014 Subzone Boundary (Web)</a>

<a href="https://data.gov.sg/datasets/d_a72bcd23e208d995f3bd4eececeaca43/view">Pre-schools Location</a>

<a href="https://datamall.lta.gov.sg/content/datamall/en/search_datasets.html?searchText=cycling%20path">Cycling Path</a>

Import Geospatial Data

In this section, we'll learn to import geosptial data using st_read().

Import Polygon Data in Shapefile Format

st_read of sf library will be used to import the Master Plan 2014 Subzone Boundary shapefile into R as polygon feature data frame. When importing the data dsn argument i sused to define data path and layer is used to provide shapefile name without extension.
