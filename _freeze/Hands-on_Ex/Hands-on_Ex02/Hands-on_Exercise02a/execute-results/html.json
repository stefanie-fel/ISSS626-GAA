In this hands-on exercise, we'll specifically explore first-order spatial point pattern analysis (1st SPPA).\n\nFirst-order Spatial Point Pattern Analysis focus on understanding intensity of points across a study area since they vary across different study area. But the analysis don't consider the interactions between individual location of points and distributions. The analysis also answers questions like **where are points are densely located**, **how spread out the point patterns are** and **if the density uniform or vary across space**.\n\nIn this exercise, we'll be using spatstat specifically to answer these questions:\n\n-   Are childcare centres in Singapore randomly distributed throughout the country ?\n\n-   If not, which location have higher childcare centres ?\n\n## Import Libraries\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npacman::p_load(sf, terra, spatstat, \n               tmap, rvest, tidyverse)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe libraries used in this exercise would be:\n\n-   sf: simple features in R to encode and analyze spatial vector data\n\n-   tmap: used to draw thematic map\n\n-   rvest: help scrape data from web page\n\n-   spatstat: spatial statistics with focus on analyzing spatial point patterns in SD (with some 3D support)\n\n-   terra: methods for spatial data analysis with vector (points. lines, polygons) and raster (grid) data\n\n## The Data\n\nIn this hands-on exercise, we'll be using the following datasets:\n\n-   <a href=\"https://data.gov.sg/collections/1749/view\">Master Plan 2019 Subzone Boundary (No Sea)</a>\n\n-   <a href=\"https://data.gov.sg/datasets/d_5d668e3f544335f8028f546827b773b4/view\">Child Care Sevices</a>\n\n## Import and Wrangle Geospatial Data\n\nFirst, we'll import the Master Plan 2019 Subzone Boundary (No Sea) in kml file.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmpsz_sf <- st_read(\"data/Master Plan 2019 Subzone Boundary (No Sea) (KML).kml\") %>% \n  st_zm(drop = TRUE, what = \"ZM\") %>% st_transform(crs = 3414)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nReading layer `URA_MP19_SUBZONE_NO_SEA_PL' from data source \n  `C:\\stefanie-fel\\ISSS626-GAA\\Hands-on_Ex\\Hands-on_Ex02\\data\\Master Plan 2019 Subzone Boundary (No Sea) (KML).kml' \n  using driver `KML'\nSimple feature collection with 332 features and 2 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 103.6057 ymin: 1.158699 xmax: 104.0885 ymax: 1.470775\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Import Polygon Data in Shapefile Format\n\nst_read of sf library will be used to import the Master Plan 2014 Subzone Boundary shapefile into R as polygon feature data frame. When importing the data `dsn` argument i sused to define data path and `layer` is used to provide shapefile name without extension.\n",
