The PA and SZ column can be used to identify to georeference to the *Master Plan 2019 Subzone Boundary* data.\n\n## Import Data\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmpsz <- st_read(\"data/MasterPlan2019SubzoneBoundaryNoSeaKML.kml\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nReading layer `URA_MP19_SUBZONE_NO_SEA_PL' from data source \n  `C:\\stefanie-fel\\ISSS626-GAA\\Hands-on_Ex\\Hands-on_Ex01\\data\\MasterPlan2019SubzoneBoundaryNoSeaKML.kml' \n  using driver `KML'\nSimple feature collection with 332 features and 2 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 103.6057 ymin: 1.158699 xmax: 104.0885 ymax: 1.470775\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Data Preparation\n",
